# Exercises for Programmers

Working through the book [Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers) along with some coworkers at CoverMyMeds.

Planning to push my exercises here as I complete them. Anything found here is likely a work in progress and almost certainly not polished.
